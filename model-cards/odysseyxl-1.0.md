## Usage

You can integrate OdysseyXL 1.0 into your project using the following code snippet:

```python
from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline

# Load the OdysseyXL 1.0 pipeline
pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("Spestly/OdysseyXL-1.0")

# Define your prompt
prompt = "A serene mountain landscape at sunrise, vivid colors, highly detailed, 8k resolution"

# Generate the image
image = pipe(prompt).images[0]

# Save or display the image
image.save("output.png")
image.show()
```
